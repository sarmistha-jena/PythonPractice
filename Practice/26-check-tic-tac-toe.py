# If a game of Tic Tac Toe is represented as a list of lists, like so:

# game = [[1, 2, 0],
# 	[2, 1, 0],
# 	[2, 1, 1]]
# where a 0 means an empty square, a 1 means that player 1 put their token in that space, 
# and a 2 means that player 2 put their token in that space.

# Your task this week: given a 3 by 3 list of lists that represents a Tic Tac Toe game board, 
# tell me whether anyone has won, and tell me which player won, if any. A Tic Tac Toe win is 3 in a row
#  - either in a row, a column, or a diagonal. Donâ€™t worry about the case where TWO people have won
#  - assume that in every board there will only be one winner.
